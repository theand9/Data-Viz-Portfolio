## Analysis of Differences
### Analysis of Visualization Methods

When exploring the debt-to-GDP ratios of different countries over time, I aimed to select visualizations that would effectively convey both historical trends and comparative insights across nations. The data source for these visualizations is the OECD’s General Government Debt database ([OECD data](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/general-government-debt.html)), which provides comprehensive figures on debt levels relative to GDP, an important indicator of economic stability and fiscal health.

The first visualization is a heatmap displaying yearly debt-to-GDP ratios for each country. This method was chosen for its ability to highlight patterns and outliers across a wide timespan and numerous countries simultaneously. The color gradient allows for immediate identification of high and low debt periods, helping viewers quickly spot which countries maintained more stable debt ratios versus those experiencing significant fluctuations. However, while this visualization is excellent for detecting general patterns and outliers, it can be overwhelming due to the volume of data presented, especially for viewers looking for specific trends in individual countries.

In contrast, the second visualization, also a heatmap, focuses on average debt-to-GDP ratios over time, providing a more consolidated view of each country’s debt trajectory. This visualization was selected to simplify the data and emphasize long-term trends without the distraction of year-by-year fluctuations. By averaging the data, I aimed to offer a cleaner view that allows for easier comparison of overall debt levels across countries. The choice of this visualization reflects a trade-off: while it sacrifices some granularity, it makes the information more digestible and highlights each country's relative debt position over the period. This method is particularly helpful for audiences interested in comparative analysis rather than specific annual changes.
