# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.

# About me
Hello, I'm Amogh Desai, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University with a passion for solving challenges across diverse sectors. I'm eager to bring my hands-on competencies in strategic thinking, stakeholder engagement, and a plethora of data science knowledge to the your company.

With experience across research centers such as the Yale Center for Consumer Insights to Unicorn Startups such as Vedantu to working on a Google-sponsored project, I bring a proven ability to drive impact. I thrive in dynamic environments, much like my love for Formula 1, where precision, strategy, and collaboration are vital for success.

I'm excited to explore how my background aligns with your firm's needs and contribute to transformative projects. I would love to know more about your experiences and discuss how I can be a valuable asset.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.
