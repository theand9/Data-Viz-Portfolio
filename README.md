# About me
Hello, I'm Amogh Desai, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University with a passion for solving challenges across diverse sectors. I'm eager to bring my hands-on competencies in strategic thinking, stakeholder engagement, and a plethora of data science knowledge to the your company.

With experience across research centers such as the Yale Center for Consumer Insights to Unicorn Startups such as Vedantu to working on a Google-sponsored project, I bring a proven ability to drive impact. I thrive in dynamic environments, much like my love for Formula 1, where precision, strategy, and collaboration are vital for success.

I'm excited to explore how my background aligns with your firm's needs and contribute to transformative projects. I would love to know more about your experiences and discuss how I can be a valuable asset.

## Final project
The project aims to unveil the hidden impact of AI on energy and electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. By visualizing data related to the electricity required for training and operating these models and the associated carbon footprint. I hope to inform and engage the audience about the environmental implications of our growing reliance on AI technologies and mitigations.
