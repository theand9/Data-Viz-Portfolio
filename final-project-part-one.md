# Outline
The rapid advancement of Generative AI technologies, such as GPT-4 and other large language models, has revolutionized various industries by automating tasks, enhancing creativity, and providing sophisticated data analysis. However, this technological leap comes with significant environmental costs that are often overlooked. This project aims to unveil the hidden impact of Generative AI on energy consumption, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions. By visualizing data related to the electricity required for training and operating these models, the associated carbon footprint, and the strain on water resources due to cooling data centers, I hope to inform and engage the audience about the environmental implications of our growing reliance on AI technologies.

## Story Structure
1. **Opening Hook**
   - Interactive comparison: "What uses more energy - training GPT-4 once or driving your car for a year?"
   - Engage readers with a personal connection to AI usage (e.g., daily ChatGPT interactions)

2. **Setting the Stage**
   1. Brief overview of how AI training works
   2. Introduction to key metrics:
      - Compute hours
      - Electricity consumption
      - Water usage
   3. Visualization of basic AI model architecture and training process

3. **The Core Story**
   1. Energy Consumption Deep Dive
      - Detailed breakdown of energy usage by model size
      - Comparison with familiar activities
      - Regional variations in energy sources and their impact
   2. Water Usage Analysis
      - Data center cooling requirements
      - Geographic distribution of AI training facilities
   3. Efficiency Trends
      - Historical progression of AI energy efficiency
      - Improvements in training techniques
      - Impact of hardware advances

4. **Solutions and Future**
   1. Emerging efficient training methods
   2. Renewable energy adoption in AI training
   3. Industry initiatives for sustainable AI
  
## User Stories
1. As a daily AI user, I want to understand my personal environmental impact.
2. As a student at Carnegie Mellon University, which is at the forefront of AI research, I want to see concrete data about AI's resource usage.
3. As an environmentally conscious person, I want to learn about sustainable AI practices.


# Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
