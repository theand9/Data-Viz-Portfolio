## The audience

Through interviews with peers and a Professor at Heinz College, I identified the primary audience for my final data story as highly engaged daily users of ChatGPT. This includes a niche but significant group: university students and professors, particularly at institutions like Carnegie Mellon. Insights from these discussions revealed that these users not only utilize ChatGPT frequently but also possess a keen interest in understanding its broader implications, including environmental and technological factors.

Research further reinforced my focus. According to Yahoo Finance [1](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-7-us-citizens-chatgpt-161614040.html), only 7% of U.S. citizens use ChatGPT daily, with the U.S. having the highest proportion of users globally. Furthermore, Pew Research Center [2](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/26/americans-use-of-chatgpt-is-ticking-up-but-few-trust-its-election-information/#who-has-used-chatgpt) reports that individuals aged 18–29 and those with advanced degrees are the most likely users of ChatGPT. These insights helped me tailor my project to an audience that is both tech-savvy and inquisitive, ensuring my story resonated with their interests and level of understanding.

To cater to this audience, I adjusted my narrative to provide depth and nuance, offering clear explanations and actionable insights rather than oversimplified soundbites. This focus allowed me to create a story that balanced complexity with accessibility, engaging readers who are both informed and curious.

## Final design decisions
As I progressed through the project, I encountered pivotal moments that shaped my final design. Initially, my research highlighted the environmental impact of generative AI (GenAI), particularly its energy consumption and emissions. However, as I delved deeper, I realized my narrative risked amplifying the common misconception that AI’s emissions are uniquely catastrophic compared to other sectors like cryptocurrency mining or industrial processes.

While it is undeniable that GenAI contributes to emissions due to the significant computational power required, its global carbon footprint remains relatively small in comparison to larger culprits. What emerged as a more pressing and constructive focus was the need to advocate for greener alternatives and decarbonization within AI infrastructure, such as adopting energy-efficient data centers and cleaner algorithms.

This shift in perspective drove key design choices in my project:
- **Clarity Over Hype**: I prioritized cutting through misinformation and hype, emphasizing that while every ton of greenhouse gases matters, the narrative should focus on solutions.
- **Call to Action**: The story was reoriented to inspire action—educating readers about sustainable practices in AI development rather than advocating for slowing progress and alarmism.

These decisions not only improved the coherence of my story but also aligned with the needs and expectations of my audience.

# Final thoughts

Reflecting on the project, I am struck by how much my understanding evolved during the process. Starting with a broad focus on the energy consumption of GenAI, I pivoted to a more nuanced exploration of the interplay between technology and sustainability. This shift not only enriched my perspective but also gave the project greater relevance and impact.

One area I wish I had more time to explore is the intersection of GenAI’s efficiency improvements and their cascading effects across industries. For example, how might advancements in AI offset emissions in other sectors? Additionally, I would have liked to examine the societal implications of green AI development, such as accessibility to low-emission AI tools in developing regions.

Overall, this project was an invaluable learning experience. It challenged me to think critically, synthesize diverse viewpoints, and communicate complex ideas in an engaging and actionable way. Most exciting of all was the opportunity to contribute to a meaningful conversation about balancing innovation with sustainability—a challenge that will only grow in importance in the years ahead.
